                In most cases, physical access to the device to be monitored is required by the user. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure they are able to
                access the target devices for between 5 - 15 minutes in order to 'bug' the target device.</p>  <p>

                In the event a purchase is made under the false assumption that physical access is not needed to install the software on the
                target/monitored device, <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> is not liable to issue any refund.

                no data will be captured until internet connectivity is restored. <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> will continue to
                work and capture data whenever internet connection is available.

                While we ensure our utmost to capture as much information as possible from monitored devices, factors out of our control may inhibit this process.
                These factors may include;

                    <ul>

                    <li>Performance of the monitored device (e.g. phone is damaged, out of memory or slow).</li>
                    <li>Monitored device is turned off.</li>
                    <li>Monitored device is installed with anti-spyware.</li>

            <p>
                <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> offers a free trial to allow for testing the compatibility of monitored devices.
            </p>

            <p>
                A user may have multiple devices on their account. Unless stated otherwise, payments will generate a coupon which can only be applied to a SINGLE device.
                To add subscription time to  other devices, additional payments must be made to create the relevant coupons.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is the responsibility of the user to ensure the relevant software works to their level of satisfaction during the trial time before purchasing a coupon.
                Once a coupon has been used/applied to a device it is NON-REFUNDABLE. Unused coupons are refundable up to 14 days after purchase date.
            </p>

            <p>
                If there is an issue with the functionality of the <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> product on your monitored device then our support staff will work with you
                to resolve the issue. The customer is required to report the issue within 3 days of applying the coupon.
            </p>

            <p>
            In the event that after a coupon has been applied, the <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> product is discovered, uninstalled, or blocked in someway on the monitored device,
            since <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> - Spy installs invisibly on the device it is assumed that it is as a result of the actions of the customer that the application
            was discovered and no refund will be issued.</p>  <p>

            The customer bears the responsibility of installation of software on the target device that needs to be monitored. Additionally, in the event a purchase is made
                under the false assumption that physical access is not needed to install the software on the
                target/monitored device, <?=APPLICATION_NAME?> is not liable to issue any refund.

                "loss" as "any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense,
                conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its
                condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages
